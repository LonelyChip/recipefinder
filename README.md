# Recipe App using Spoonacular API

This project is a simple recipe app created with Create React App and the Spoonacular API. It allows users to search for recipes using keywords and view detailed information about each recipe, including the ingredients and cooking instructions.

## Usage

To use this app, you will need to replace the Spoonacular API token with your own in the `src/config.js` file. Once you have added your API token, you can run the following scripts in the project directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

Removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project.
